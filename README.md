# TREBLE
Streamlined TREBLE code for behavioral analysis of flies

In order to work with these TREBLE files, you must have your file structure set up correctly. Everything you are working with should be inside one main folder that you can call whatever you want. This folder should include:
- treble_functions_220321.R
- TREBLE_CE.Rmd
- A folder containing the CSV files of your controls
- A folder containing the CSV files of your experimentals

You should never need to modify any code, only some names of files and paths. Simply run each block in TREBLE_CE.Rmd one at a time, fill in any file paths or names it asks you for, and update the name of a file anywhere you see ###&&&Change_path&&&###
